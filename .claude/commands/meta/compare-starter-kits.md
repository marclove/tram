description: Analyze other popular CLI starter kits to identify gaps in Tram
---

## Research Targets
- **Rust CLI starters**: cargo-generate templates, other Rust CLI frameworks
- **Language ecosystems**: create-react-app (JS), Spring Boot (Java), Rails (Ruby)
- **CLI-specific tools**: cobra (Go), click (Python), commander (Node.js)

## Task
Research and compare CLI starter kits:

1. **Feature comparison**: What do other starters provide out-of-the-box?
2. **Developer experience**: How easy is it to get started?
3. **Architecture patterns**: Common approaches to CLI organization
4. **Missing features**: What does Tram lack compared to alternatives?
5. **Unique value**: What makes Tram special?

## Analysis Areas
- **Project scaffolding**: How do they bootstrap new projects?
- **Configuration management**: Multi-source config approaches
- **Testing utilities**: Built-in testing support
- **Distribution**: Release and packaging automation
- **Documentation**: Quality and completeness of guides

## Output
- **Feature gap analysis**: What Tram should add
- **Best practices**: Patterns to adopt from other ecosystems
- **Competitive positioning**: Tram's unique strengths
- **Roadmap suggestions**: Items to add based on research
