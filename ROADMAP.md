# Tram Roadmap

Development roadmap for improving Tram as a CLI starter kit foundation.

## Phase 1: Core Foundation
1. [x] Basic Cargo.toml with clap + starbase dependencies
2. [x] Minimal working CLI with subcommands (`init`, `workspace`, `config`)
3. [x] AppSession implementation template
4. [x] Basic error handling with miette + thiserror
5. [x] Configuration loading (TOML/YAML/JSON)
6. [x] Workspace detection utilities
7. [x] Basic logging and tracing setup

## Phase 2: Developer Experience
1. [x] Interactive project initialization (`tram new <name>`)
2. [x] Template generation for common CLI patterns
3. [x] Hot reload development mode
4. [x] Built-in testing utilities and fixtures (tram-test crate)
5. [x] Comprehensive example commands (6 interactive examples)
6. [x] Shell completion generation (bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell)
7. [x] Man page generation (with build automation)
8. [ ] Release automation (GitHub Actions)

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Plugin architecture foundation
- [x] Multiple output formats (JSON, YAML, table)
- [x] Progress indicators and spinners (examples implemented)
- [x] Interactive prompts and confirmations (examples implemented)
- [x] File watching and live updates (config hot reload)
- [ ] Concurrent task execution
- [ ] Configuration validation schemas
- [ ] Environment-specific configs (dev/staging/prod)

## Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration
- [ ] Docker containerization templates
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline templates
- [ ] Package manager integration (Homebrew, Scoop, etc.)
- [ ] Update notification system
- [ ] Crash reporting and telemetry (opt-in)
- [ ] Performance profiling utilities
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] Cross-compilation support

## Phase 5: Advanced Patterns
- [ ] Daemon/service mode support
- [ ] IPC communication patterns
- [ ] Database integration templates
- [ ] HTTP client utilities
- [ ] Authentication flow patterns
- [ ] Caching strategies
- [ ] Background job processing
- [ ] Distributed CLI coordination

## Phase 6: Developer Tooling
- [ ] Code generation macros
- [ ] Custom derive macros for CLI patterns
- [ ] Development server with API introspection
- [ ] CLI testing framework
- [ ] Benchmarking utilities
- [ ] Documentation generation
- [ ] Migration utilities between versions
- [ ] Debug mode with enhanced diagnostics

## Non-Goals
- Framework-specific integrations (web frameworks, databases)
- GUI applications
- Language bindings for non-Rust languages
- Complex domain-specific logic
- Third-party service integrations (unless generic patterns)

## Success Metrics
- Time from fork to first working CLI: < 5 minutes
- Lines of boilerplate code eliminated: > 200 per project
- Common CLI patterns covered: > 80%
- Community adoption and contributions
- Zero-config developer experience for standard use cases
